# the \<wit\> project starter repo for react's "intro to react" tutorial


_Today, we're going to be following a great [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) from the React docs! But let's take care of some things first._
<br><br>



### ðŸ–¥ Install node.js
Before we start our workshop today, we need to install **Node.js**.

You might be thinking, "wait, what is node.js?" Well before we get into that, let's talk about JavaScript. JavaScript, like Python, is an interpreted language. This means an interpreter reads each line, interprets it, and runs it _just-in-time_ and traditionally, this only happened in the browser context.

Node.js allows you to run JavaScript outside of the browser by providing an asynchronous, event-driven JavaScript runtime. This opens up the possibility of using JavaScript to write servers or command line tools.

You can install Node.js using their [installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you're running Mac Os. Alternatively, you can use brew (`brew install node`).

Once Node.js is installed, you can execute JavaScript programs locally using  the `node` command. Node also comes with a package manager, which you can use with the `npm` command.

### ðŸ–¥ Install this project locally
1. Clone this repo: `git clone <this repo's remote url>`
2. Change directories: `cd wit_react_starter`
3. Install the project dependencies: `npm install`

_Great! Now you can start the local development server by running _npm start_. The React app is hosted on localhost:3000. Any changes to your code will cause the server to hot reload._

### ðŸ–¥ Get started!
Now you're ready to get started! You can find the tutorial [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). Make sure to read all of the sections as they are very informative. However, you _can_ skip the "Setup for the Tutorial" section, since we've set up this start code for you.
